# InverterModelling

This codebase takes inverter specification data and PV input MPP data and generates AC output alongside data insights.

The codebase currently uses an example 4 kW string inverter with an efficiency curve that can be considered typical and an example year of hourly PV array output for a 4 KW array made up of two parallel strings of eight 250 W modules.
